![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/guidominguesdev/codeboost-consuming-pokeapi.svg)

## Adjustments and improvements

This is a [CodeBoost](https://codeboost.com.br/) course project that has been improved and adjusted from the original version presented in the course. The changes include:

- Illustrations in `.svg` format were loaded inline.
- Added to the project: [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/).
- The images were loaded in a different folder from the illustrations.
- All `.scss` files are now organized into subfolders.
- New SASS variables and mixins were created to avoid code repetition.
- Applied the `@use` and `@forward` techniques in SASS instead of `@import`.
- The `.js` files were reorganized into separate directories.
- Almost all components and assets were readjusted to be faithful to the Figma layout.
- Improved responsiveness.
